## Forking and Customization

On my site, I've included a contacts section that uses a Formspree form to handle emails sent by users. 

Please follow these steps after forking the repository:

1. Go to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and create a free account if you haven't already.
2. After logging in, create a new form and obtain the unique token.
3. In the `index.html` file, find the following code:

```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/######" method="POST" id="contactForm">
```
  Replace the token `######` with your newly obtained Formspree token.

4. For a fresh start from scratch download the zip file and after extract use the template folder, it will be very helpful.</br> Template :
